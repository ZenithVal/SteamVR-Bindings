# SteamVR Bindings
A Collection of Bindings I've created for SteamVR.

## Installation/Usage
1. Navigate to the file here on Github & then click the download button on the top right.
2. Place the json file inside `(Your Documents)\steamvr\input\imports` (create imports folder if needed)
3. In SteamVR, Navigate to [VRChat's binding config.](https://wiki.vrchat.com/wiki/Community:SteamVR_Bindings#Where)
4. Select the newly added binding from the list of `"Bindings in the documents directory"`

<sub>You don't need to close steamVR to do any of this.</sub>

If something is broken please DM me or [create a Git issue.](https://github.com/ZenithVal/SteamVR-Bindings/issues).
